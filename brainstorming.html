            </div>
            <p>Constantly anticipating our outing to the Lekki Conservation Center, the team felt extremely disappointed when the rain prevented our visit not once, but twice. Instead of strolling through and marveling at the beauty of Mother Nature, we found ourselves confined to the training room, with the sound of heavy rain beating against the windows.</p>
            <p>In response, we made a collective decision to shift our focus to the Hydrogen Horizons challenge and our strategies. Intensive discussions ensued, ideas were exchanged, sketches were drawn, and humor prevailed amidst our determination. By the end of the brainstorming sessions, everyone had gained a comprehensive understanding of the challenge, and we had generated multiple options to explore for our robot's design.</p>
            <p>This experience marked one of our first true adversities as a team, but it became an opportunity for growth and innovation. Although going to the Conservation Center would have been slightly more fun, we transformed this setback into a valuable learning experience."</p>
