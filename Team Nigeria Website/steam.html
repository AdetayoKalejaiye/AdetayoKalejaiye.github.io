            <p>How could we proudly call ourselves Team Nigeria, a group of innovative and creative minds capable of inspiring the average Nigerian child that the fact they are Nigerian means they're so much more than average, if we didn't do just that? This question led us to have a session at Topgrade Secondary School, a local secondary school that was having a summer coaching program.</p>
            <p>It would be lovely to say that everything went perfectly, but not all wishes come true. The session seemed doomed from the beginning: deadlines were missed, lines were forgotten, and tempers were lost.</p>
            <p>But seeing the kids watch in awe as Abdul produced hydrogen and with delightful smiles as they crowded around Daanish and Tayo as they raced with the starter bots and insistently asked how they could make their own, made us remember why everything we went through was worth it. I certainly hope that we made those kids feel special, because they certainly made us feel so.</p>
