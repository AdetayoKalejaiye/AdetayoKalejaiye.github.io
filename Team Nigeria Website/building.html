            </div>
            <p>In our effort to face the Hydrogen Horizons challenge head-on, Team Nigeria engaged in the exciting process of building our robot. Each team member brought their passion, dedication, and creative ideas to the project. We explored various aspects of robotics, including designing pulley-based intakes for precise cargo handling and creating versatile holonomic drivetrains for smooth movements.</p>
            <p>Building the robot was a mix of imaginative thinking and careful engineering. We gathered around tables filled with wires, parts, and prototypes, often working late into the night. Challenges motivated us to work harder, and setbacks gave us opportunities to learn and come up with new solutions.</p>
            <p>As our robot took form, so did our teamwork and collective knowledge. We refined our mechanisms, wrote code for autonomous actions, and conducted thorough testing to ensure our robot would perform well in the Hydrogen Horizons challenge</p>
            <p>Through this experience, we learned about the importance of working together, solving problems, and tapping into our creativity. The robot became a symbol of our dedication and unity, showing our commitment to representing Nigeria globally.</p>
