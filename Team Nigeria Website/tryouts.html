                "They say the journey of a thousand miles begins with a step;<br> it turns out that the journey of a lifetime begins with a video."

            <p>During the fateful month of April, eight remarkable students sent a video that would change their lives forever:<br>
                <ul type="none">
                <li><b>Temitope Johnson,</b> a teenage motivational speaker and serial entrepreneur (and there have been A LOT of businesses).</li>
                <li><b>Abdulazeez Adekunle,</b> a dynamic engineer who not only thinks outside the box but has no box.</li>
                <li><b>Daanish Meehra,</b> an intelligent debater with the most diverse music taste you'll ever see.</li>
                <li><b>Fiyinfoluwa Oluokun,</b> a skilled builder who is always ready for a FIFA match.</li>
                <li><b>Osadebamwen John-Nejoh,</b> a cheerful student who expects the best from the world.</li>
                <li><b>Mojoyin Adeshina,</b> a quiet girl with the sunniest personality you'd ever meet.</li>
                <li><b>Bashirat Sulaimon,</b> a hyperactive girl with boundless social energy.</li>
                <li><b>Adetayo Kalejaiye,</b> a sarcastic programmer who's always ready to make a witty comment.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>These eight individuals did not know that they would be selected out of two hundred and twenty others to not only be on the team but also to accompany one another on a journey they'd never forget.</p>

                Thoughts from Bashirat Sulaimon about Tryouts:<br> During tryouts, I felt a mix of nerves and excitement,<br/> but I was ready for whatever happened.<br/> When I got picked, I was super happy!"
