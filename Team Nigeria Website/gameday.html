                "Who's up for a round?" 
            </div>
            <p>As we settled into a perpetual rhythm of unending work, an idea emerged to infuse excitement into our lives—a game day. On this day, we dressed in cultural attire, shared our favorite foods, and indulged in our most beloved games. Game day dominated our conversations in the week leading up to it. Discussions revolved around what to wear and which games to play, creating a sense of anticipation.</p>
            <p>For the students preparing for the WAEC exams, this day represented a final opportunity for enjoyment before the grueling exams—a form of salvation. They were fully prepared to make the most of it.</p>
            <p>And the day did not disappoint. It commenced on a delightful note with spicy puff-puff (a popular Nigerian street pastry) prepared by Tayo. Excitement soared even higher when the games emerged. Students swiftly claimed their favorite characters, from Scarlet to Jax Briggs, and engaged in intense Mortal Kombat battles. Coach Yinka quickly established himself as the grand champion. While football might be our national sport, it seemed that many of us lacked the same enthusiasm for the video game version, in which Fiyin quickly dominated and crowned himself champion.</p>
            <p>We also delved into the mentally demanding Quartets, a game Mojoyin had a particular fondness for. However, the highlight of the day was the food. From steaming amala with egusi to pav-bhaji and bread, we embraced the opportunity to learn about and share each other's cultures. Gathering around a table, sharing food and laughter, was a pivotal moment in defining who we are as a team.</p>
